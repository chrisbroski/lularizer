# LuLaRizer

Python script to add style, size, and price to clothing photos.

I was going to make this repository private but was surprised to find a few people were already following. I assume you are LuLaRoe husbands, so I consider you my brothers. In the spirit of shared adversity, I have added some reasonable command line arguments and this quick introduction.

## System Requirements

I am developing and running the script on OSX. It probably wouldn't be difficult to get it running on a Windows machine (probably just changing forward slashes to backward), but I don't have one at the moment for testing. It's on my to-do list.

You will need to install Python. I successfully tested the lularize.py script with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, so choose whichever you think is best.

This script relies heavily on PIL (the Python Image Library) so you will need to install that. I am using the Pillow fork which is easy to install if you have *pip*.

`pip install Pillow`

If you don't have *pip*, you should be able to get it like so:

`python get-pip.py`

## Options

You can get information about the command line options in the standard way:

`python lularize.py -h`

I'll add more information soon, but that should get you started.
